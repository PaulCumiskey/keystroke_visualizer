# Keystroke Visualizer

A simple Python GUI application that demonstrates how keyboard input is handled within a focused application window.

Built to better understand event-driven programming and input processing from a defensive security perspective.

## Features

- Displays pressed keys in real time  
- Detects modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt)  
- Maintains short in-session history  
- No system-wide capture or persistent logging  

## Security Note

This tool only captures input while the application window is active. It does not monitor background activity or store data externally.
